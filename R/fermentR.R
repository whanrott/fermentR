## General documentation for fermentR package

#' fermentR: A package of converters and calculators for brewers of beer and
#' other fermented drinks.
#'
#' This is a placeholder description
#'
#' The fermentR package covers areas of interest to brewers:
#'
#' Converting between units of gravity (which measure concentration of sugars in water).
#' Calculating useful characteristics water chemistry and suggesting treatment (planned).
#' Calculating composition and temperature of mashes.
#' Calculating usage and effect of hops.
#' Calculating amounts of alcohol in fermented worts.
#' Calculating gas volumes in fermented worts and suggesting gas line lengths to control dispense (planned).

#' @param Adjunct Any additions to the mash which do not contribute starch converting enzymes (amylase). Commonly includes added flavourings.
#' @param Goods The grist whilst in the mash tun.
#' @param Grist The mix of grains and adjuncts which will be combined with liquor in the mash.
#' @param Gyle A batch of beer. Usually a single use of the mash tun.
#' @param Hop A strain of the plant Humulus Lupulus which gives flavour to beer and inhibits spoilage micro-organisms. Hops are added to the wort before, during or after the boil. Dry hopping is an addition to the during or after fermentation.
#' @param Liquor Water which will be used during the brewing process.
#' @param Malt The seed of a cereal crop which has been partially germinated and then kilned. The most common malts are Barley and Wheat.
#' @param Mashing The process of mixing liquor and grist at specfic temperatures to release fermentable sugars.
#' @param Sparge The process of rinsing out fermentable sugars from the mash. Fly sparging uses a gentle showering method; batch sparging drains and refills the mash tun.
#' @param Wort The liquid which is drained from the mash tun. The wort can be fermented to make beer.
#' @param Yeast A micro-organism capable of converting some sugars to alcohol. Usually Saccharomyces Cerevisiae or Saccharomyces Pastorianus. A range of bacteria are also used in some types of brewing.
